          I have always been a self-learner, both in and outside of school. When I took classes in C, most of my training came from my own curiosity, researching outside of class. I even managed to show the teacher a hidden functionality of C he wasn't aware of. When my classes were over, I was curious how hackers used C++ and assembly to reverse games like Dark Souls and create new events, so I started delving into the world of reversing. When my brother, who works with me at Cities Market Studios, started automating some of our business with Python, I started Python coding challenges to learn not only to parse through data, but to do it in an optimal fashion (something my classes with C taught me as well).

          When I started making music, I didn't want to be a producer. I wanted to be a singer. But I had no instrumentals to sing over, so I started producing out of necessity. Overtime, I became fascinated with how people got certain mixes or sounds, and 9 years later producing is one of my biggest passions. When I wasn't satisfied with my voice, I scoured the web for articles about the anatomy of the voice, trying to bridge the gap between the sound I want and the sound I have. 
        </p>

          I bring all of this up because I have a long history with intense research, even if it's a subject I am not that interested in. I am known to hear one little claim about one topic, and heavily read about it until 5:00AM. I don't like to have missing information, and I tend to be happy when I am learning. And programming is an endless supply of learning.
